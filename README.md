# Title: professional-portfolio

## Description: 
As an employee, my employer would like to see a depolyed portfolio that shows my projects that i've worked on as well being creative and more information about me. On my portfolio, I have shown all my projects i have worked on so far including the links so you're able to tap on the titles as well as my resume on the bottom of the page. The resume is a pdf format, you can download the link by taping on it or go on the next web-page. As you will see i also included a little brief information about me. However, duirng this project, I leanred more about css styling, Flexboxx, Grid and little advanced styling. Challenges I faced were on the CSS styling, padding, bordering, aligning, etc but with practice i'll be able to master it. 

## Table of Contents

## Installation
Refactor the code from git, coppied the html and uploaded it in VS code, you'll see the files that it contains and will be able to navigate where you would want to start editing. I created the index sheet along with creating the style sheet, having it side by side i was able exceed lot faster.
